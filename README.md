## Questions

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs involves actively listening to stakeholders, gathering requirements, and translating their expectations into actionable goals. User stories are a powerful tool in this process because they capture user needs in a clear, concise, and relatable format. Each story focuses on what the user wants to achieve, why it matters, and provides a starting point for developers to design and implement features that directly address those needs. By using user stories, teams can ensure the program stays aligned with user expectations while remaining flexible to adapt to changes.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development with an iterative mindset, breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable increments. Agile processes, such as Sprint Planning and Daily Standups, are central to my development workflow. These practices enable constant communication, allow for quick adjustments, and ensure the delivery of value in short, consistent cycles. In future development work, I aim to incorporate practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Retrospectives to enhance code quality and continuously improve team performance.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to the team’s success through collaboration, effective communication, and mutual respect. It involves sharing knowledge, supporting peers, and being open to feedback. A good team member also embraces accountability, takes ownership of their tasks, and prioritizes the team’s goals over individual preferences. By fostering a positive team dynamic, I can help ensure project success and build a stronger, more cohesive team.
